##  Variables & Mutability
- **Variables**: Declare and initialize variables using `let` keyword.
- **Mutability**: Use `mut` to make a variable mutable.


## Data Types
- **Basic Types**: `i32`, `f64`, `bool`, `char`.
- **Compound Types**: `struct`, `enum`, `tuple`.

## Control Flow
- **If-Else**: Use `if` and `else` for conditional execution.

## Loops
- **For Loop**: Iterate over a range or collection.
- **While Loop**: Execute a block of code while a condition is true.

## Owenership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes
- **Ownership**: Rust's unique approach to memory management.
- **Borrowing**: Access data without transferring ownership.
- **Lifetimes**: Ensure data remains valid during its use.
