# Summary

This is the simplest possible Rust program. It defines a main function and prints "Hello, world!" to the console when run. It’s equivalent to the classic “Hello, world!” example found in most programming languages.

# Explanation

``` Rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

## `fn` keyword
- This keyword stands for function.
- It is used to define a function in Rust.
- Functions are a way to group a set of statements together to perform a specific task.

## `main()` function
- This is the entry point of the program.
- It is the function that is called when the program starts.

## `{ ... }`
- Curly braces define the body of the function.
- All the code inside will be executed when the function is called (in this case, automatically by the Rust runtime when the program starts).

## `println!` macro
- This is a macro provided by the Rust standard library.
- It is used to print text to the console.
- The `!` after `println` indicates that it's a macro, not a regular function.
- Macros in Rust are used for code generation and manipulation.
- The semicolon ; at the end signifies the end of the statement.
