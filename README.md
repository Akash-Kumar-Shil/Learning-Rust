# 🦀 Learn Rust – A Journey from Beginner to Pro

Welcome to **Learn Rust**, a personal repository to document, practice, and share everything I learn while mastering the Rust programming language. This repo is structured to grow as I progress from the basics to advanced concepts in Rust.

git clone https://github.com/Akash-Kumar-Shil/Learning-Rust.git
cd Learning-Rust
```


```bash 
# Run an example
cd basics/hello-world
rustc hello_world.rs
./hello_world
```

## 🧩 Resources
Here are some of the resources I'm using to learn Rust:
- [The Rust Programming Language (The Book)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygL_xcavzQ4)


## 🖥️ Rust Playground
I've set up a [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/) where you can experiment with Rust code snippets.
